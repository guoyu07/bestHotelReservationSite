# bestHotelReservationSite
Best Hotel Reservation site is the redesign of the popular website Bookings.com. This website was created when i was a student in SCAD. The purpose of the website was to see how much effective key word domains name can be. So i exported the website from Photoshop which uses tables, so that search engines can not read the content inside pictures and tables. We just want to test the effectiveness of the keyword. I searched key words from Google Adwords and setup a domain from those popular keywords and uploaded the website. Now i am analyzing the data generated by google Analytics, to measure the organic traffic on the website.
